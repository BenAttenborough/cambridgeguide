var kingsText = '<p><b>King\'s College</b> is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England. Formally named The King\'s College of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas in Cambridge, the college lies besides the River Cam and faces out onto King\'s Parade in the centre of the city.</p>' +

'<p>King\'s was founded in 1441 by Henry VI, soon after he had founded its sister college in Eton. However, the King\'s plans for the college were disrupted by the Wars of the Roses and resultant scarcity of funds, and his eventual deposition. Little progress was made on the project until in 1508 Henry VII began to take an interest in the college, most likely as a political move to legitimise his new position. The building of the college\'s chapel, begun in 1446, was finally finished in 1544 during the reign of Henry VIII.</p>' +

'<p>King\'s College Chapel is regarded as one of the greatest examples of late Gothic English architecture. It has the world\'s largest fan-vault, and the chapel\'s stained-glass windows and wooden chancel screen are considered some of the finest from their era. The building is seen as emblematic of Cambridge. The chapel\'s choir, composed of male students at King\'s and choristers from the nearby King\'s College School, is one of the most accomplished and renowned in the world. Every year on Christmas Eve the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols (a service devised specifically for King\'s by college dean Eric Milner-White) is broadcast from the chapel to millions of listeners worldwide.</p>' +

var RoundText = '<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, is an Anglican church in the city of Cambridge, England, and is known locally as The Round Church. It is located on the corner of Round Church Street and Bridge Street. Since 1950 the church has been designated a Grade I listed building, and is currently managed by Christian Heritage. It is one of the four medieval round churches still in use in England.</p>' +
'<p>The church was built around 1130, its shape being inspired by the rotunda in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem. It was built by the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre, who were probably a group of Austin canons. It consisted of a round nave and an ambulatory, with a short chancel, probably in the shape of an apse. Initially it was a wayfarers\' chapel on the Roman road known as Via Devana (this is now Bridge Street). By the middle of the 13th century it had become a parish church under the patronage of Barnwell Priory. Around this time structural alterations were made to the church, with the rebuilding of the chancel and the addition of a north aisle, the aisle being shorter than the chancel. During the 15th century the Norman style windows in the nave were replaced by larger Gothic style windows. The carvings of angels in the roofs of the chancel and aisle were added. A polygonal bell-storey was built over the nave. In 1643, during the Civil War, many of the "idolatrous" images were destroyed. By the 19th century the church was in a poor state of repair. Part of the ambulatory collapsed in 1841, and the Cambridge Camden Society offered to carry out repairs. They appointed Anthony Salvin for the purpose.</p>'+
'<p>Salvin replaced the bell-storey by a roof similar to the original roof. This was made necessary because the weight of the bell-story was too much for the walls to support. The 15th-century Gothic windows were replaced by windows in Norman style, and a formerly-inserted gallery was removed, together with the external staircase leading to it. To compensate for this, a new south aisle was added. It was found that the east wall of the chancel was unstable and this was replaced. Then the north aisle, by that time in poor condition, was also rebuilt, extending it to the same length as the chancel. The original estimate for the cost of the restoration was £1,000 (£80,000 as of 2014), with the parish paying £300 (£20,000 as of 2014); in the event it cost nearly £4,000 (£310,000 as of 2014), with the parish providing only £50 (£4,000 as of 2014). In 1899 a vestry was added to the north of the north aisle; this was extended in 1980. The Victorian stained glass in the east window was destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War and was replaced in 1946. By 1994 the congregation had become too large for the church, and they moved their gatherings to the nearby Church of St Andrew the Great.'+

Cockerell and opened in 1848; the entrance hall is by Edward Middleton Barry and was completed in 1875. The first stone of the new building was laid by Gilbert Ainslie in 1837. A further large bequest was made to the University in 1912 by Charles Brinsley Marlay, including a sum of £80,000 and a collection of 84 pictures.
